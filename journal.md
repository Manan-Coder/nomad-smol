Hey y'all, this is the second prototype of my project 'nomad'. The goal behind this project is to make 3d printers portable and foldable. You can find the v1 of this project here  - https://github.com/Manan-Coder/nomad

The first version was a foldable 3d printer which turned into a suitcase, it used telescopic rails and dampers and hinges for the folding mechanism to work. It was kind of able to pull of its goal, it flods and turns into a suitcase and works like a normal 3d printer when unfolded. But its still too bulky, its like a 60cmx50cm suitcase, its rigid and has like a box like figure so still like big and heavy. This version of my project aims to fit a 3d printer in a back carry bag, a printer which you can carry like books. My goal is to bring the three axes of a 3d printer into one when folded. So this is my attempt at it -
